ModernApps
==========

ModernApps will be a collection of apps built using modern technologies, techniques and designs.



###ModernWeb  (demo : http://developermx.azurewebsites.net)

Building out a framework that delivers functionality found in very modern websites and modern UI/UX's like
  - Outlook.com
  - Office365.com
  - Office Web Apps
  - Skydrive.com

Design will closely mirror Metro found in 
  - Windows 8
  - XBox360
  - Windows Phone 8

Its built using TypeScript where possible, the bits that arnt are third-party libraries. However over time I envision converting these third party libraries into TypeScript enabled libraries

Needs:   
  - VS2012
  - Azure .NET SDK ( http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/ )
  - TypeScript 0.8.2 ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790 )  

  
Demo:
  - running on azure websites the demo can be buggy as it is forever under development
