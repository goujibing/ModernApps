  - It will look/feel like Outlook.com
  - Functionality will be based around delivering a "Forums" like site
  - Needs:
      - VS2012
      - Azure .NET SDK ( http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/ )
      - TypeScript 0.8.2 ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790 )
