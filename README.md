ModernApps
==========

ModernApps will be a collection of apps im building using modern technologies and techniques .. This is more a playground for me to test out ideas and new technologies.





ModernForum 

  - Its built using 100% TypeScript (except for the thirdparty libraries i consume)
  - It will look/feel like Outlook.com
  - Functionality will be based around delivering a "Forums" like site
  - Needs:
    
      - VS2012
      - Azure .NET SDK ( http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/ )
      - TypeScript 0.8.2 ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790 ) 


  - Demo:
      - running on azure the demo can be buggy as it is forever under development
